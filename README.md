## What Am I Currently Working On?

* **Currently (Professionally):** I am leading the development of **JotoPro** at **ANT**, focusing on PID control algorithms for automated poultry brooder systems.
* **Currently (Research):** I am working on **Matikas Energy**, developing sand battery prototypes to store renewable energy as heat for long-duration storage.
* **Personal Project:** Building a custom solar power bank using recycled Li-ion cells and designing the BMS (Battery Management System) PCB.

## My Mission and Vision

* 🎯 🌍 **My Mission:**

> To engineer robust, affordable agritech and energy solutions that solve real struggles for farmers and off-grid communities. I believe in hardware that is not just functional, but intuitive and built to last.

* 🎯 🏁 **My Vision:**

> I want to leave behind a world where technology bridges the gap between subsistence farming and profitable business. Through ANT and Matikas, I aim to empower users with tools that give them control over their production and energy needs.

## My Professional Projects

*Here are the repositories for my core projects:*

### 🐣 [AC-Fan control (Triac) ](https://github.com/Steven-369/AC-fan-control)
>The schematics and PCB designs  for the Fan control circuit. Includes the Triac and diac triggering, this circuit enables smooth control of AC voltage — ideal for applications like lamp dimming, fan speed regulation, and heater control.

### 🔋 [Matikas Sand Battery Controller](https://github.com/Steven-369/INSERT-LINK-HERE)
> Temperature logging and heating element control system for the sand battery prototype.

### ⚡ [Solar Power Bank BMS](https://github.com/Steven-369/INSERT-LINK-HERE)
> PCB files (KiCad) and documentation for my custom 18650 Li-ion power bank project.
